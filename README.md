##About the Game

Your investor (Mr. Okafor) arrives in 2 hours expecting a proper Naija spread — but your phone contacts are completely scrambled. You need to quickly figure out who's really who so the right family members can help rescue your Jollof, Egusi, and Fufu before everything burns or quality tanks.

###How to Play

- **Tap any contact** → listen to their voicemail
- **Decide:** Is this actually your Mom / Aunty / Uncle… or a restaurant / wrong number?
- **✅ Correct guess** → quality improves + family member helps dish
- **❌ Wrong guess** → quality drops (softer early on) + group chat gets suspicious
- Watch the chat — missed calls and hang-ups make them connect dots

###Goal

Identify the correct family members in time to save dinner and impress your investor!
