# Spice Interference

A cognitive game that builds scent memory through words alone. Black and white evolves into color chaos across 6 levels.

## How it works

Each level asks you to find a specific African spice among floating words. Pop the correct ones before time runs out. Each correct pop reveals a scent description — over time, your brain builds a composite smell memory through repetition alone.

## The progression

- **Level 1:** Black & white — find BERBERE
- **Level 2:** Black & white — find HARISSA  
- **Level 3:** Color appears, but it's noise — find MITMITA (word only)
- **Level 4:** Color matters — find BERBERE in its correct red
- **Level 5:** Faster + colors shift mid-round — find HARISSA
- **Level 6:** Maximum speed, colors shift, target changes without warning — find MITMITA

## Why smell without smell?

Smell is the only sense that bypasses the thalamus and goes straight to memory and emotion. By pairing repeated visual cues with varied scent descriptions, the brain starts to build an olfactory memory without any actual odor.
